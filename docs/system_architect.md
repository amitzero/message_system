# System Architect Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture for our email-based messaging app. It focuses on high-level system design, technology stack, deployment strategies, scalability, and security measures.

---

## High-Level Architecture
The messaging app is designed as a distributed system using microservices. It includes the following key components:
1. **Frontend** (Flutter Web and Mobile Apps)
2. **Backend** (Node.js with NestJS Framework)
3. **Database** (PostgreSQL for relational data and Firebase Firestore for real-time messaging)
4. **Authentication** (Email-based login with JWT for session management)
5. **Cloud Hosting** (Google Cloud Platform)
6. **Encryption** (End-to-end encryption for messages)

## Technology Stack
| Component       | Technology                 |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Frontend         | Flutter                   |
| Backend          | Node.js (NestJS)         |
| Database         | PostgreSQL, Firebase Firestore |
| Authentication   | Firebase Authentication  |
| Cloud Hosting    | GCP (Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Functions) |
| Encryption       | RSA and AES algorithms   |

---

## Deployment and Scalability
1. **Containers**: Docker is used to containerize the backend services.
2. **Orchestration**: Kubernetes ensures scalability and high availability.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions.
4. **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system performance monitoring.

## Security Measures
1. **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**:
   - Messages are encrypted with AES before being sent.
   - RSA is used to exchange keys securely.
2. **Authentication**:
   - Firebase Authentication for email-based login.
   - JWT tokens for secure session management.
3. **Data Security**:
   - Messages are stored encrypted in Firebase Firestore.
   - User credentials are stored in Firebase Authentication.

---

## Scalability and Failover
- **Auto-Scaling**: Kubernetes automatically scales services based on traffic.
- **Load Balancing**: GCPâ€™s Load Balancer ensures equal traffic distribution.
- **Backup**: Daily database backups using GCP Cloud Functions.
- **Failover Mechanism**: Replicated database setup for failover handling.
